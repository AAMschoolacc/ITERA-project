<p align=center>BASALTIC</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>Basaltic rocks on the Moon are similar in composition to basaltic rocks found on Earth. They are dark in color and are rich in iron and magnesium.</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>Lunar basalts are primarily composed of minerals such as pyroxenes, plagioclase feldspar, and olivine.</td>

<p align=center>These rocks are primarily the result of ancient volcanic activity on the Moon’s surface and are commonly found in the lunar maria.</td>

<p align=center>ANORTOSITHIC</td>

<p align=center>Anorthositic rocks are light in color and are predominantly composed of a mineral called plagioclase feldspar.</td>

<p align=center>They are mainly composed of plagioclase feldspar, with smaller amounts of other minerals.</td>

<p align=center>BRECCIAS</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>Lunar breccias are composite rocks formed from fragments of various rock types and impact-generated materials that have been fused together.</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>Breccias can contain a mixture of basaltic and anorthositic components, along with other minerals and impact melt.</td>

<p align=center>They are formed as a result of meteorite impacts on the Moon and are valuable for studying lunar impact history.</td>

<p align=center>REGOLITH</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>Lunar regolith is not a single rock type but a layer of loose, fragmented material covering the Moon’s surface.</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>It consists of a mixture of small rock and mineral fragments, dust, and tiny glass beads formed by meteorite impacts.</td>

<p align=center>Regolith is the surface material of the Moon and provides insights into lunar surface conditions and the history of impacts.</td>

<p align=center>IMPACT MELT ROCKS</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>These rocks are formed when the intense heat generated by meteorite impacts causes surrounding rocks to melt and then solidify.</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>Impact melt rocks can contain a mix of various lunar minerals and glassy material.</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>They are a product of high-velocity impacts on the Moon and are valuable for understanding impact processes.</td>

<p align=center>KREEP</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>KREEP rocks are enriched in potassium (K), rare earth elements (REE), and phosphorus (P). They are relatively rare on the lunar surface.</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>They contain a variety of minerals but are distinguished by their enrichment in K, REE, and P.</td>
    <td><font face="Agency FB" size=4 color="yellow"> 
<p align=center>KREEP materials are thought to represent concentrated deposits in certain areas of the Moon’s crust.</td>
