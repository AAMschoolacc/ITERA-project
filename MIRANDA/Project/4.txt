The moon causes the tides on Earth, due to its gravitational pull. There are two bulges of water on opposite sides of the Earth, one facing the moon and one facing away from it. As the Earth rotates, these bulges move around the oceans, creating high and low tides. The moon’s gravity also causes moonquakes, which are similar to earthquakes but much weaker.
